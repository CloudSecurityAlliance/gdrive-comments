"""The text of each specimen — the file's own content IS its documentation.

Every specimen explains itself: what it is, which measured finding it evidences, what to look
at, and what a human still has to place by hand. So the file works as documentation the moment
somebody opens the link, and it cannot drift away from the fixture it describes — because it
*is* the fixture.

Two rules hold for everything in here:

**Synthetic only.** This drive is public, permanently, and indexable. No real document content,
no real names, no real numbers from anything.

**The anchorable material does double duty.** A specimen about anchoring needs text to anchor
comments to, so the explanation and the fixture are the same paragraphs. That is deliberate: a
separate "test area" would invite somebody to comment on the explanation instead.

WHICH COMMENTS CAME FROM WHERE, AND WHY IT MATTERS
Comments labelled A, B and C were created through the **Drive API** (`comments.create`). Any
other comment on this file was placed **by a human in the {editor}**.

That distinction is not bookkeeping — it is the finding. An API-created comment cannot carry a
real anchor: Drive stores whatever anchor you send and the editors then treat the comment as
un-anchored, {orphans}. Only the editor mints an anchor that works. So if a comment here looks
broken, check its label first: an A/B/C comment looking broken is the specimen working."""

README = """google-workspace-api-specimens

WHAT THIS FOLDER IS
Files that exhibit specific, measured behaviours of the Google Workspace APIs. They exist so a
claim about how comments work can be CHECKED rather than taken on trust: open the file, look at
the sidebar, see the thing.

Maintained by CSA's CINO office, alongside the open-source csa-google-workspace library.

THESE ARE SPECIMENS, NOT EXAMPLES
Do not copy anything here as a template. Several of these files are deliberately malformed: a
comment quoting text the document does not contain, a header row that is not row 1, a selection
that crosses a paragraph boundary. They are useful precisely because they are wrong in specific,
documented ways.

EVERY FILE DOCUMENTS ITSELF
Open one. It says what it is, which measured finding it evidences, what to look at, how it was
made, and what a human still has to place by hand. There is no separate key to hold, and the
documentation cannot drift from the fixture because it IS the fixture.

WHY SOME COMMENTS LOOK BROKEN
Comments labelled A, B or C were created through the Drive API. An API-created comment cannot
carry a real anchor — Drive stores whatever you send and the editors then treat it as
un-anchored — so it renders as "Original content deleted", shows no quoted text, draws no
marker in the body, and is hidden from the default sidebar view. Only the editor mints an
anchor that works.

So an A/B/C comment looking broken is the specimen working. That behaviour is the finding.

HOW TO USE THIS
Read: open the files. Experiment: take a copy into your own Drive and change it freely — but
note that copying a Google file DROPS EVERY COMMENT, which is itself one of the findings here,
so a copy is not an equivalent fixture.

RULES
Everything here is synthetic. There is no real content and there never should be.
These files are cited BY ID from csa-google-workspace. Renaming and moving are safe — a Drive
file id survives both. Deleting breaks the citation. Please do not tidy this folder."""
