"""A dated snapshot of one person's document footprint, for a work handoff.

Somebody is unavailable — on leave for a month, or handing their work over — and a question
arrives that cannot wait for them. This answers *"where is their work, and what is in it?"* as a
flat table somebody else can work through.

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-work-handoff-inventory.md`. Read it before changing the
shape here; the four decisions below were made deliberately and each has a reason that is not
obvious from the code.

## This is a snapshot, not a cache

Accessors re-fetch per call and there is no caching layer (settled 2026-08-30). That decision was
reasoned from the LIVE multi-reviewer case, where staleness lands in exactly the sessions this tool
is for. A handoff inventory is the inverse: the person whose footprint is being reconstructed is
not editing, so a frozen view is the correct answer and should not drift while a colleague works
through it.

Two things keep it from becoming a cache by the back door, and both are load-bearing:

**It is a deliverable, not an index.** The output is rows, destined for a dated CSV or Sheet that a
person is handed. There is nothing internal to invalidate and no hidden state.

**It is never an access path.** Reading a file's CONTENT still goes through the normal authorized
call. An id appearing in an inventory grants nothing.

## Edited and commented are separate signals

Kept apart on purpose, because they answer different questions and have very different costs.

`edited_last_by_subject` comes from Drive's `lastModifyingUser`, which is the MOST RECENT editor
only. **If the subject edited a file and somebody else edited it afterwards, the subject is
invisible in this column.** It answers *"did they touch it last"*, never *"did they ever touch
it"*. That is a property of Drive, not of this code: the complete answer needs `revisions.list`
per file, which is opt-in because the cost is the caller's to accept.

`comments_by_subject` is exact, because `comments.list` returns every author on every thread. It is
also the only cross-file view of somebody's commentary that exists — Drive has no `/comments`
collection and no comment predicate in `files.list`, so this is absent by construction there.

## What could not be reached is REPORTED, never dropped

The sharpest requirement here, and it follows from the delineation: this library runs **as a
user**, while the list of files to sweep may come from an administrator using a different tool.

If 500 ids come in and the user can see 340, that is **not a failure** — it is the boundary working
as designed. But a table of 340 rows *lies by omission*: it reads as a complete footprint, and
somebody handing over work would conclude the other 160 files do not exist.

So every id that could not be reached appears in `unreachable` with a reason. This is the same
asymmetry `labels.py` applies — an unreachable label is reported as `None` with a reason rather
than omitted, *because reporting a classified document as unclassified is the dangerous direction*.
Here the dangerous direction is reporting a partial sweep as a whole one.

## Derived columns are empty and stay empty

`summary`, `keywords`, `tags` and `notes` are always blank. They are the point of the artifact
being a worksheet rather than a printout, and they are the CALLER's to fill — this library does not
summarise. It is embedded in tooling that already holds a model; the moment it calls one itself it
acquires an API key, a cost model and a second trust boundary, and stops being embeddable.

There is deliberately **no read-back path.** `_apply.py` gives the comment register one, and
generalising it here would be wrong: a comment register is a set of intended ACTIONS on one file,
while this is a DESCRIPTION of somebody's work. Nothing in it is an instruction, and treating
`notes` as one would turn an analyst's jottings into Drive writes.
