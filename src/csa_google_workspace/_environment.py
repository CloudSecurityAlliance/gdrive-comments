"""The facts a bug report needs, and nothing that identifies a document.

Every question asked on an issue starts the same way — which version, which Python, which OS —
and the answer is always a round trip. This collects them once so a report can arrive complete.

**What is deliberately absent is the point of the module.** This output is written to be pasted
into a *public* issue tracker, so it carries no file ids, no document titles, no email address,
no token, and no filesystem paths. A Drive file id is not a secret in the cryptographic sense
and is very much a secret in the practical one: it is a working link to a document. `Policy`
scopes are therefore reported by *shape* — unrestricted, or "3 files" — never by content.

That is the opposite choice from `describe_configuration`, which does list the ids, and rightly:
there the audience is the person asking "what am I allowed to touch?" about their own machine.
Same data, different destination, different answer.
