# edit to a document, it is a claim about how the organisation must treat that document. A model
# that could relabel `Confidential` to `Public` would be defeating a control rather than using
# one. Reading them is the useful half anyway - "what is this document classified as?" is the
# question people actually ask - so this library asks for `.readonly` and cannot mislabel
# anything even when the operator has enabled every capability.
#
# It is also a SEPARATE API (`drivelabels.googleapis.com`). A granted scope does not enable an
# API: until it is switched on in the Cloud project these calls 403 `SERVICE_DISABLED`, which is
# why `labels.py` degrades to ids-without-names rather than failing the call.

    **A SUBSET CHECK, not an allowlist of known write scopes (#327).** The previous version

    different clothes — and a denylist can be walked around by anything not on it. A token
    carrying `drive.file`, a real write scope this project happens never to request, answered
    **False** and passed as read-only.

    That mattered because of where it is used: deciding whether a cached credential is safe for
    a read-only posture (`:130`). A token that can write, accepted as one that cannot, is the
    exact failure `CSA_GW_READ_ONLY=1` exists to prevent.

    So the question is inverted. Anything **outside** the read-only set is treated as a write
    scope, whether or not this project has heard of it. An unlisted scope can no longer outflank
    the check, and a scope Google adds tomorrow is handled correctly the day it appears.

    A credential with **no** scopes reported is not a licence: `granted` is empty on some
    refresh paths, and answering "no write scopes" there would be the permissive reading of
    missing information. It answers `True` — the conservative direction, matching the rule this
    codebase follows everywhere that absence and denial look alike.
