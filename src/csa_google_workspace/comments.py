        `anchor` presence and `quoted_text` presence are independent, so there are **four**
        combinations. Three were measured from the editor on 2026-09-02
        (`experiments/docs-anchor-states/`); the fourth was measured from the API on
        2026-09-03 (`experiments/api-created-comment-states/`) after a consumer hit it on real
        material (#372):

        | `anchor` | `quoted_text` | state | means |
        |---|---|---|---|
        | absent | absent | `ANCHOR_FILE` | about the document, not a passage |
        | present | absent | `ANCHOR_OBJECT` | an image, a drawing, a cell - a location, nothing to quote |
        | present | present | `ANCHOR_TEXT` | the ordinary case |
        | absent | **present** | `ANCHOR_QUOTE_ONLY` | **quoted a passage, recorded no anchor** |

        **`ANCHOR_QUOTE_ONLY` is API-created and is NOT file-level.** The editor cannot produce
        it - it snaps a bare caret to the enclosing word and refuses to comment on empty space
        - so it only ever arrives from a tool writing through the Drive API. And such a tool is
        usually *right* to omit the anchor: an API-supplied anchor is stored verbatim and then
        treated as un-anchored by the editors (measured 2026-07-09), so a client that knows
        this drops the useless field and keeps the quote. Expect this state on any file another
        tool has written to; it is not corruption.

        **The anchor itself is opaque** - `kix.…` in Docs, `workbook-range` in Sheets - so it
        is a key, not a coordinate, and deliberately not exposed. This property is the part of
        it that carries information.

        A quote is counted as present when it is non-empty rather than merely non-`None`.
        Drive OMITS an absent field rather than sending it empty (measured), so `""` should not
        occur - and if it ever does it carries no passage, so it must not read as one. (This is
        safe here in a way the rule in CLAUDE.md's invariant 9 warns about elsewhere: a quote
        is a string, never a legitimate `False` or `0`.)

        Equivalently `anchor_state != ANCHOR_FILE`. Use `anchor_state` when the difference
        between the three attached states matters.

        **This is not raw anchor presence, and the change was a bug fix (#372).** It used to be
        `self.anchor is not None`, which reported `False` on comments carrying 244 characters of
        quoted text that this library's own context resolution placed in a specific paragraph -
        4 of 90 threads on one real document. `False` reads as *"there is no passage to look
        at"*, so a consumer skipped exactly the comments a reviewer had quoted at length. Silent,
        and in the confident direction.

        Raw anchor presence was the wrong thing to expose because **nothing can act on it**: the
        anchor string is opaque and not published, and the one anchor-derived feature here
        (`context`) locates by quoted text instead - which is why three of those four rows
        resolved to a paragraph correctly even while this field denied they had one.

        What it answers now is the question callers ask: *is there a passage this is about?*
