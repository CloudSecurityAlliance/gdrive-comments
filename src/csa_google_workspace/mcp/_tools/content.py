"""Content tools: identify a file, read its text, download its bytes.

Names and parameter names match Google's Drive MCP server and the claude.ai Drive
connector exactly, so a user's habits transfer between them
(research/drive-mcp-servers-and-api-surface.md).

Parameters are camelCase because the wire contract is, and because a pydantic
`Field(alias="fileId")` cannot bridge that gap: it publishes the right schema and then
fails every call — the SDK dumps the validated model *by alias* and calls `fn(**kwargs)`,
so the handler receives `fileId=` and raises `TypeError`, surfacing as an
`UnexpectedToolError` with the message suppressed. A camelCase wire name must be the
literal Python parameter name. These handlers are a wire adapter; adapters are named after
the thing they adapt, and the library's own API stays Pythonic.
