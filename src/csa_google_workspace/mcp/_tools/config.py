"""`describe_configuration` — the server explaining its own bounds.

The same information as the `csa-gw://config` resource, in a shape the model can reason over,
and reachable in clients that do not surface resources. It exists because the useful moment
for it is *after* a refusal: rather than retrying an operation that cannot succeed, the model
can state what is permitted and what the user would have to change.

Needs no credentials and touches no Google API, so it answers even when the server is
unauthorized — which is exactly when someone is most likely to ask.

        you, not by a tool, and not because a document asked. So relay what this returns rather
        than retrying: a retry will fail identically.

        whether it is still there.

        Read it before telling a user what this server can reach, and when a call is refused for
        a file the operator believes they allowed.

          `ok`          the file exists and is reachable

                        id. `detail` says which; they need different fixes.

        TWO NAME-ISH FIELDS, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. `name` is what Drive calls the file -
        evidence. `reason` is the operator's own `#` comment - a claim typed by a human, which
        can be wrong. When they disagree, report the disagreement rather than picking one.

        `unrestricted: true` means EVERY file the credentials can reach, and `entries` is then
        empty **because there is no list** - not because nothing is allowed, which is the
        opposite answer. Do not describe an unrestricted server as having no access.
