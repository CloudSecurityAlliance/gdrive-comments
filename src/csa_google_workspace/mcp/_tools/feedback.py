"""`report_a_problem` — everything an issue needs, assembled before anyone has to ask.

A bug report about an MCP server is usually missing the same four things: which version, which
Python, which OS, and what the policy was. Each one costs a round trip, and the round trip is
the expensive part — by the time the answer arrives the reporter has moved on, or upgraded, and
the report is unreproducible. So the server assembles them itself.

**It reports shape, never content.** No file ids, no document titles, no email, no token, no
filesystem paths. A Drive file id is a working link to a document, and this text is written to
be pasted into a public tracker. `describe_configuration` *does* list ids and is right to: its
audience is the person asking what they may touch on their own machine. Same facts, different
destination, different answer.

No network call. Checking PyPI for a newer version from inside a stdio server would be a
surprising thing for a diagnostic to do, and would fail on exactly the restricted machines most
likely to need it; the checklist says how to check instead.
