"""The `login` subcommand — the only code path permitted to run interactive consent.

Isolated in its own module on purpose. The server imports `_config`, never this, so
`InstalledAppFlow` is not reachable from the stdio process even by mistake: it is not in
the call graph. `run_local_server()` prints the consent URL with a bare `print()` and
blocks on the browser redirect — harmless in a terminal, fatal under stdio where stdout
carries JSON-RPC.

    Scope is deliberately narrow: the replacement changes the *response body only* and

    authorization code, and oauthlib validates `state` from it). Token exchange is
    untouched.
