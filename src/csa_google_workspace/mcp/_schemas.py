"""Structured-output shapes for tool results.

Plain dicts built by hand rather than re-exporting the domain models, for two reasons:
the models carry deliberately redacting `__repr__`s and mutation methods that mean nothing
over the wire, and the wire shape is a contract we control independently of the library's
internals. `author` is the display name only — email is usually absent from the API and is
not surfaced (SECURITY.md). Comment *content* is returned: the agent needs it, and the
redacted repr protects logs, not tool output.
