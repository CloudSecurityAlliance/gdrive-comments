  CSA_GW_READ_ONLY=1     refuse writes (also narrows the OAuth scopes)
  CSA_GW_PROFILE         a named capability set: reader | commenter | editor | full.
                         reader may change nothing; commenter may comment, reply and
                         resolve; editor adds content edits and file creation; full adds
                         rename/move, trash and share. Default: editor.
  CSA_GW_CAPABILITIES    which mutations are permitted - the complete list, not a delta.
                         Unset means the safe default: comment and content writes on,
                         file rename/move, trash and share OFF. Tokens: any capability
                         name, plus `default`, `all`, `none`.

  CSA_GW_ALLOWLIST_MODIFY  which files may be CHANGED, added to, or deleted

                         Both FAIL CLOSED: unset means nothing is permitted. Each holds
                         either `*` or the document URLs themselves - there is no
                         allowlist file, and a path-shaped value is reported as a
                         mistake rather than read.

                         The usual posture:
                           CSA_GW_ALLOWLIST_READ=*
                           CSA_GW_ALLOWLIST_MODIFY=https://docs.google.com/document/d/AAA/edit

                         Entries are separated by newlines or commas; `#` starts a
                         comment and the comment is the reason. A value of just `*` means
                         every file. Anything unusable is a hard failure, never a
                         fallback to unrestricted access, and the error says which kind
                         of mistake it was. Folders are not supported yet and are
                         rejected loudly.
