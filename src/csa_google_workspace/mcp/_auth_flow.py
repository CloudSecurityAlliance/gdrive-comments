"""Loopback OAuth pieces for in-band authorization, without `run_local_server()`.

`InstalledAppFlow.run_local_server()` cannot be used here for two reasons: it `print()`s
the consent URL to stdout (which is the JSON-RPC channel), and it blocks the calling
thread until the browser redirect arrives. In-band auth needs the URL as a *value* to
hand to the client, and needs the wait to happen without stalling the event loop.

So the flow is driven directly:

    start_loopback()            -> a listener on 127.0.0.1:<random port>
    authorization_url(flow)     -> the URL to show the user
    wait_for_redirect(listener) -> the full redirect URI, once Google calls back
    flow.fetch_token(authorization_response=...)

`fetch_token` is given the whole redirect URI rather than a bare code, so oauthlib
validates the `state` parameter for us — that check is what stops a CSRF-style injected
authorization code, and losing it would be the easy mistake in hand-rolling this.

Loopback with a random port is Google's documented pattern for desktop clients ("start an
HTTP listener on a random available port"), and no redirect URI needs pre-registering.
The out-of-band copy/paste alternative no longer exists — Google removed it — so a
listener is not optional.
