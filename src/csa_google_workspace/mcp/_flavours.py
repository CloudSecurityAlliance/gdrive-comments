"""Restrict this server to another Drive server's surface — allowed *and* advertised.

`CSA_GW_FLAVOUR=google|claude|full`, default `full`.

**A flavour is a surface guarantee, and it has two halves that only work together.** Only those
tools are allowed, and **only those tools are advertised** — the rest are never registered.

The second half is the point, and it is what an earlier framing of this feature missed. Matching
names is not a drop-in replacement: a model shown 55 tools behaves differently from one shown 11,
however identical the eleven are. It plans differently, reaches for things that are not there in
the server it is standing in for, and spends context on schemas it will never call. Advertising
without allowing would be a lie; allowing without advertising is what this server did until now.

## What the vendors actually expose

Verified against live schemas (`research/drive-mcp-servers-and-api-surface.md`), not from docs.
The claude.ai connector publishes **11**; Google's publishes those minus the three it declines to
ship — `update_file`, `share_file`, `trash_file` — for **8**.

The shared tools are genuinely the same tools: names and parameters match, and only the
descriptions differ. That alignment work landed long before this switch and is what makes the
switch cheap.

## Why some tools survive every flavour

`ALWAYS` is not a hedge. A flavour restricts **the Drive surface** — which operations on
documents exist. It is not a promise to be unusable or undiagnosable:

* **`authenticate`** — without it, an install with no cached token has no way to get one, and the
  server is bricked rather than restricted. Google's server has no equivalent because it is
  hosted and authorized elsewhere; ours is a local subprocess and this is how it is switched on.
* **`describe_configuration`** — this is *where the server says what it is hiding*. Hiding the
  tool that explains the hiding would be perverse.
* **`read_server_resource`** — the route to `csa-gw://help/capabilities`, which is what a model
  reads to learn a thing is impossible rather than guessing. Several clients surface resources
  only to the user, so without this tool the model cannot reach them at all.

Everything else is Drive surface and is filtered.

## The tradeoff this must handle

Hiding a tool changes what a refusal looks like. With `share_file` registered but gated, an agent
gets *"the `file.share` capability is disabled for this server; an operator enables it in
configuration"* — informative, and relayable to the user. An **absent** tool instead reads as
*"this server cannot do that"*, and the model may report it as impossible or go looking for
another route — the route-around-a-refusal failure `csa-gw://help/capabilities` exists to prevent.

So a flavour **says what it is hiding**: in the server instructions the model reads at startup,
and in `describe_configuration`. Restriction that announces itself is a restriction; restriction
that is silent is a missing feature.
