"""The passage around a comment's anchor — because the anchor records where a comment was
ATTACHED, not what it is ABOUT.

Usually those coincide. Often enough they do not, and no exotic cause is needed: a reviewer
selects three words of a paragraph-length point, clicks the line above the one they meant, or
writes *"at the end of this paper the conclusion is weak"* while the comment sits on page 1.
A human reading the comment beside its passage notices instantly and compensates without
registering it as an event; a consumer treating `quoted_text` as the subject cannot.

So this treats the anchor as a **localization hint that gets tested**, which degrades
gracefully: a sloppy selection plus its surrounding paragraph still finds the right text,
whereas a sloppy selection believed absolutely produces a confident wrong answer (#358).

## Why it locates by QUOTED TEXT and not by the anchor

Because the anchor cannot be used. MEASURED 2026-09-02
(`experiments/docs-anchor-states/RESULTS.md`): a real Docs anchor is an opaque `kix.…` id and a
Sheets anchor an opaque `workbook-range` — a **key, not a coordinate**. Google's one published
example carries a `line` number and is not what the editors produce.

That looked fatal and is not, because of two other measurements: the editor **expands a bare
caret to its enclosing word**, and **refuses to comment on empty space at all**. So quoted text
is present wherever text is, and the only anchored comments without it are on non-text objects,
where there is no textual context to give anyway.

## What it is strict about, and why that is the right call FOR NOW

Everything here is deterministic: the chunk is chosen by structure, and `context_kind` says
which rule fired. **The strictness is a property of the producer, not the consumer** — an AI
reading this could cope with fuzziness, but software choosing the passage must be explainable or
nobody can say why a given chunk came back.

A future AI-chosen variant is additive rather than a redesign: it adds a member to `KINDS` and
puts its reasoning in `note`. Two things are left in place for it — the vocabulary is closed so
a new member is a deliberate act, and **the context is not promised to be contiguous**: disjoint
spans are joined by `GAP`, unused today.

## The one honest failure

A quote occurring **more than once** cannot be placed, and there is no tiebreaker because the
anchor is opaque. Short selections make this *more* likely, so the comments that most need
context are the ones most at risk of not getting it. Reported as `KIND_AMBIGUOUS` with a count,
never guessed — a marker in the wrong place is worse than no marker, because it is not visibly
wrong.
