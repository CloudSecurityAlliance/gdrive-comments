"""Comment export: flat rows, ready for a spreadsheet or for another tool entirely.

Two audiences, and **neither of them is an AI**, which is the reason this exists rather than
leaving people to compose three tools:

- somebody who would rather work in a **spreadsheet**. A register of every thread, with the text
  each one is about, is how document review has always been done, and this makes that better
  rather than obsolete.
- **another tool** — a notebook, a BI query, `grep`. Flat rows with a thread id feed anything;
  nested JSON does not.

**Flat, one row per comment AND per reply**, with `reply_to` naming the thread. That is the
lossless shape: one-row-per-thread is a trivial group-by away, and the reverse is not recoverable.
`columns` is returned in order so writing a sheet is a loop rather than a judgement call.

The interesting part is the last column, and it is per-type, because *what a comment points at*
is a different fact for each:

    Docs     `quoted_text`  - the passage, from Drive's quotedFileContent
    Sheets   `cell_text`    - what the cell actually HOLDS. A comment on B11 is meaningless in
                              a register unless the register also says B11 is "Q3 revenue".

And the Sheets half produces an unexpected answer to the multi-tab problem (TODO.md D3). We
cannot know which tab a comment is on — the XLSX export carries no correlation from a
`threadedComments` member back to a sheet name. But we can report that cell **on every tab**,
and the *content* then tells a human which it was: if B11 is empty on Summary and reads
"Q3 revenue" on Detail, the comment is about Detail. That resolves the ambiguity in practice
without the code guessing, which beats both guessing and refusing.
