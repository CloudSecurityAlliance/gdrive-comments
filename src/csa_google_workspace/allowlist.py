"""The file allowlists: which documents may be read, and which may be changed.

**Configured entirely through the environment. There is no file to read.**
`CSA_GW_ALLOWLIST_READ` and `CSA_GW_ALLOWLIST_MODIFY` hold the lists themselves, so they live
in the same place the MCP server is declared — a shell, `.mcp.json`, Claude Desktop's config.

That is a deliberate restriction rather than a missing feature. The client configuration is
the artifact an operator controls and can *see*: reading it tells them exactly what the agent
may touch. A path adds an indirection whose target can change without the config changing,
puts the real policy somewhere nobody looks, and makes the path itself a thing that can be
mistyped or redirected. The cost is that a long list is less pleasant in JSON than in a file;
that is the trade, and it is accepted knowingly.

**Deliberately the simplest thing that works: a flat list of document URLs.** No folders, no
patterns, no wildcards beyond `*`. Folders are the interesting design problem and they are
*not* solved here — see `TODO.md`, "Folders in the allowlist", for why folder-as-rule is
harder and more dangerous than it looks. Until that is settled, a folder URL is a **loud
error**, not a silently-inert entry.

Enforcement is by **file id**, not by URL string. Every URL form for the same document
normalises to the same id, so a pasted `/edit?tab=t.0` link is the same entry as a
`?usp=sharing` one — and a *copy* of an allowlisted document has a different id and is
therefore not allowlisted, which is the correct default.

**Three outcomes, and the third one is the point.** A value is either `*` (everything), a set
of document URLs, or **unusable** — and unusable always means *nothing permitted*, never
"ignore the setting". Because "unusable" covers a lot of ground, `diagnose_url` and
`diagnose_setting` say which kind it is.

Format — one URL per entry, newlines or commas separating them, `#` starting a comment. In a
JSON `env` block, `\n` gives you the multi-line form and keeps the reasons:

    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oW1BM…/edit?tab=t.0   # CCM v5 mapping, per WG lead
    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1abc…/edit          # AICM tracker

Leading, trailing and interior whitespace is insignificant, so entries can be indented and
aligned however reads best — tabs included. Blank lines and whole-line comments are ignored
anywhere. A comment starts at a `#` that begins the line or **follows whitespace**, which is
what lets a URL keep an `#gid=0` or `#heading=h.x` fragment. The reason itself is free text:
quotes, apostrophes and further `#`s in it are fine here — though whatever holds the value,
JSON or a shell, has its own quoting rules to satisfy.

Per-capability scoping — "this file may be commented on but not edited" — would need a
structured format. That is a deliberate later decision, noted in `TODO.md`.
