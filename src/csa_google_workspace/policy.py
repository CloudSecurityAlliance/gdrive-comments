"""Capability gating — the first of #82's two dimensions.

https://github.com/CloudSecurityAlliance/csa-google-workspace/issues/82

#82's settled requirement surface separates two independent things:

1. **Capability gating at all** — may this deployment create comments? trash files? share
   them? Each on or off, globally. *This module.*
2. **Per-URL scope** for each enabled capability — *and* which files. Still to come.

The composition rule is that **global is a ceiling and per-file grants narrow, never
widen**, so building dimension 1 first is not a half-measure: dimension 2 can only ever
subtract from what is allowed here.

Why that ordering matters in practice: it lets the destructive tools ship *off*. A default
install cannot trash or share anything before the per-file allowlist exists, which closes
the window that would otherwise open between shipping those tools and finishing #82.

**Enforcement is a `Backend` wrapper, not a check in the tool layer.** Every `Backend`
method takes `file_id` first (or, for the account axis, nothing), which is what makes a
uniform wrapper possible at all — and it means an embedder using the library directly gets
the same guarantee as one going through MCP. `read_only` is the precedent; this is its
fine-grained sibling.

**Fail closed.** `_GATES` must name every `Backend` method. An unlisted name raises rather
than delegating, so adding a method to the protocol without deciding its gate is a loud
failure at import/first-call, not a silent hole. `tests/test_policy.py` asserts the
coverage so it fails in CI instead.

# --- the default: EVERYTHING ON, and the documentation's job is how to narrow it ----------
#
# Reversed 2026-08-28 (v0.31.0). Until then the default was "everything reversible" and both
# allowlists failed closed, so an unconfigured install refused every operation. The reasons for
# reversing it are mostly already written in this repository:
#
#   * The README already told operators to set `CSA_GW_ALLOWLIST_READ="*"`, and explained why
#     the fine-grained alternative is not what anyone wants. The fail-closed default was
#     contradicted by our own documented happy path; what it reliably produced was a setup step.
#   * `THREAT_MODEL.md` §1 names Drive as the PRIMARY control layer and this one as "defense in
#     depth, deliberately narrow ... not the primary layer and not intended to be". A
#     deliberately-narrow secondary layer that bricks the tool on install is inconsistent with
#     its own stated role.
#   * Somebody installing a Google Workspace MCP server intends to do Google Workspace things.
#     A control every operator disables during setup is not a control; it is a support burden
#     that additionally teaches people to paste `*` without reading.
#
# AND THE ARGUMENT THAT MAKES IT COHERENT RATHER THAN A RETREAT: a capability we enable is not a
# permission we grant. Every call still executes as the authorizing user against Google's ACLs -
# `organizer` on a file where that user is merely a Commenter still cannot edit it, because the
# API returns 403 and nothing here changes that. This model is a CEILING BELOW DRIVE'S, never an
# expansion of it, so "everything on" means *subtract nothing; let Drive decide*.
#
# `file.share` is included. It was argued for exclusion - not on the get-work-done path, so
# enabling it removes no real friction, while being the only capability whose effect leaves the
# organisation and cannot be recalled. Overruled deliberately by the CINO: Drive owns sharing
# policy, and an organisation that cares has sharing restrictions, target audiences and DLP
# available there. Recorded because a default that was argued about is worth being able to find.
#
# WHAT DID NOT CHANGE: `PolicyBackend` still fails closed on an unlisted `Backend` method. That
# is a code-safety invariant, not a posture, and must not be simplified away alongside this.
#
# The recoverability ordering that used to draw this line still exists and still matters - it is
# what `CAPABILITY_NOTES` records and what orders the profiles above. It no longer decides what
# is ON, only what an operator is told when choosing what to switch OFF.
DEFAULT_ENABLED = frozenset(ALL_CAPABILITIES)

# Kept as a name because the docs, the config resource and the profile ladder all refer to "the
# three you cannot take back". They are no longer off by default; they are the three an operator
# most often wants to remove, and `organizer` is the only profile that includes them.
IRREVERSIBLE = frozenset({COMMENT_EDIT, COMMENT_DELETE, FILE_SHARE})

# Nothing is off by default any more (see above). Kept as an empty set rather than deleted,
# because it is part of the public surface and something may still ask "what is disabled?" - the

# mean: the three an operator most often wants to remove.
DEFAULT_DISABLED: frozenset[str] = frozenset()

# What each capability lets an install do, and whether Google gives you a way to undo it.
#
# This lives HERE, beside the constants, because it was previously restated from memory by
# every surface that explains the policy - the README, the `csa-gw://help/configuration`
# resource, `describe_configuration` - and the copies had drifted apart. The help resource
# had `editor` able to "tidy comments" (it cannot: `comment.edit` and `comment.delete` are
# `full`) and put rename/move and trash under `full` (they are `editor`). A model reads that
# resource to explain a refusal, so a wrong copy there is worse than a wrong README: it
# becomes an answer given to a user with the server's authority behind it.

# The recoverability column is the same one the comment above draws the default line on. It
# is stated once and rendered, rather than retyped per surface.

# Named capability sets, mirroring GOOGLE DRIVE'S OWN ROLES.
#
# Named as the Drive API names them - `reader`, `commenter`, `writer`, `fileOrganizer`,
# `organizer` - rather than with a vocabulary of our own. An operator already holds Google's
# model of who may do what to a file, because Google taught them and they use it daily. A more
# precise model sharing none of its words makes them hold two and map between them, and the
# mapping is where mistakes live.
#
# It is also externally validated in a way our own reasoning was not. The v0.21.0 rework drew
# the line on "can this be undone?" and got a better answer than the verb-alarm ordering it
# replaced - but that was one project's reasoning. Drive's roles are the same problem solved at
# enormous scale, and they agree on the point that matters: WRITER CANNOT SHARE. Google
# withholds sharing from Editor and reserves it for Manager and Owner.
#
# The API string is what the config accepts, because it is what `get_file_permissions` returns -
# so the word in the configuration and the word in a tool result are the same word. UI labels
# are documented and REDIRECTED (see `mcp/_config.py`), never silently accepted.
#

# which documents a deployment may touch is inherently specific to that deployment, and a
# named default for it would be a named default for "which of your files an agent may change".
