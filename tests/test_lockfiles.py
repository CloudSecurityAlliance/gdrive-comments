"""What CI installs is recorded here, and the two things that are deliberately not.

**T18.** Nothing in this tree pinned what the automation installed. Every job resolved
lower-bound-only ranges live from PyPI, including the release job whose entire output is the
artifact published under our name. `requirements/*.txt` fixes that with hash-pinned closures;
these tests assert the wiring, because a lockfile that exists and is not used is worse than
none - it reads as a control from the outside.

**The published ranges stay permissive**, and that is not an inconsistency. Pinning a
*library's* dependencies pushes a resolution problem onto every application that installs it.
The 2026-07-22 audit called the permissive ranges "benign and standard for a library"
(GA-#28); the 2026-08-27 one called unpinned CI a supply-chain gap (T18). Both are right about
different questions, and the split between `pyproject.toml` and `requirements/` is the answer
to both.

**Two carve-outs are asserted as carve-outs**, so that "fixing the inconsistency" fails here
with the reason attached rather than quietly removing a signal:

  * the `security` job resolves freely, because `pip-audit` reporting on our own lockfile
    would be reporting on the one environment nobody installs;
  * `pip` is the runner's, because `pip install --upgrade pip` is an unpinned fetch by the
    tool that is about to verify every other hash.
