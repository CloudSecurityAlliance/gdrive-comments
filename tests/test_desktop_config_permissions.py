"""The desktop config is written `0600`, and its backups do not accumulate forever.

`claude_desktop_config.json` was written with `path.write_text(rendered)` — no explicit mode, so
whatever the umask gives, typically `0644`. And every changed run snapshotted the previous
version to `.bak.<stamp>`, never pruned.

**No secret value lands there**, and that is deliberate: `CSA_GW_CLIENT_SECRETS` is excluded by
`carried_env()` with the reasoning written down. What *does* land is:

  * `CSA_GW_TOKEN`, which points any local reader straight at the full-Drive token, and
  * the allowlisted document URLs, which are the policy itself.

So the file is a map to the credential and a statement of what may be touched. World-readable is
the wrong default for that, and each stale `.bak` preserves **a policy the operator believes they
have since tightened** — which is the worse half: an old backup is not merely clutter, it is a
record contradicting the current intent, sitting next to it, with an older timestamp.

**Backups are capped rather than dropped.** They exist because a second run must not destroy the
copy of a file somebody hand-wrote, and that reason survives; what does not survive is keeping
every one of them since installation.
