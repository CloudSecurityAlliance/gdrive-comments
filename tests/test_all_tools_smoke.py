"""Every registered tool is callable, described, and declared.

The per-tool suites check behaviour. This checks the thing none of them can: that the *set* is
whole. A tool can be registered and never exercised anywhere, and the failure is silent — it
ships, a model calls it, and it raises. So this walks the registry itself rather than a list
somebody maintained, and a new tool is a test failure until it has smoke arguments here.

It also enforces the three properties every tool needs regardless of what it does:

  * it runs and returns structured output
  * it has a non-empty description — the only interface documentation a model gets, and
    previously missing entirely from one tool because an f-string cannot be a docstring
  * its parameters are camelCase literals — `Field(alias=...)` publishes a correct schema and
    then fails EVERY call, because the SDK dumps by alias and calls fn(**kwargs)
