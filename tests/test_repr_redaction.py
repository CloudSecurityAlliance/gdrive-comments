# Everything above is a hand-maintained list, and a hand-maintained list of things that must
# be checked is exactly the shape that goes stale: `AccessProposal` was added with a redacting
# `__repr__` and every test here still passed when that `__repr__` was deleted, because none of
# them had heard of it. `Permission` had been missing for longer.
#
# So this reflects over the package instead, the way `tests/test_policy.py` reflects over
# `Backend`: every `@dataclass` either writes its own `__repr__` or is named below with a
# reason. Adding a model then forces the decision rather than defaulting to "generated".
#
# Read statically with `ast` rather than by importing: `pkgutil.walk_packages` over this
# package HANGS, because importing every module runs things that were never meant to run at
# import time. A guard that has to import the world is a guard that stops being run.
