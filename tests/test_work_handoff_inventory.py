"""A dated snapshot of one person's document footprint, for a work handoff.

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-work-handoff-inventory.md`.

The tests worth reading are the ones about **what the artifact does not know**, because those
are the failures that look like successes:

**A partial sweep must not read as a whole one.** This library runs as a user, and the list of
ids may come from an administrator using a different tool. If 500 ids arrive and 340 are
readable, a table of 340 rows is a *lie by omission* — somebody handing over work would conclude
the other 160 files do not exist. So `unreachable` carries every one with a reason, and the first
caveat says so in words.

**Blank is not zero and not FALSE.** `comments_by_subject` is blank when comments were not
gathered, and `edited_last_by_subject` is blank when there is no subject to compare against. The
same three-state discipline `_apply.decision()` exists for, and the same failure if it breaks:
a blank read as FALSE asserts the subject did *not* touch a file nobody asked about.

**`edited_last_by_subject` is Drive's last editor.** If the subject edited and somebody else
edited afterwards, it reads FALSE — correctly, and misleadingly if a reader takes it for "never
touched this". There is a test that pins exactly that scenario, because it is the one a wrong
sweep is built on.
