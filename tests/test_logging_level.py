"""Diagnostics reach stderr at a level you can set, and never carry document content.

**#145, rescoped.** This was specced as a logging subsystem — JSONL writer, log directory,
session ids, retention, `0600` — until somebody checked whether the MCP client was already doing
it. It was: Claude Code keeps per-connection JSONL with a `sessionId` under
`~/Library/Caches/claude-cli-nodejs/`, capturing our stderr **verbatim**, and Claude Desktop does
the same independently in a different format. Two clients, not coordinating.

Their version is also better than one written here — it is the *parent* capturing the *child*, so
it survives the server failing to start, crashing, or hanging, which is when a log is most wanted
and when a self-written file is missing. So the whole feature collapsed to **a level, and what to
say.** Full write-up: `CINO-Platform-Engineering/research/mcp-servers/
LOGGING-BELONGS-TO-THE-CLIENT.md`.

Three properties are worth holding, and they are the three that would be expensive to get wrong:

1. **Nothing reaches stdout.** Under stdio that IS the JSON-RPC channel; one stray line corrupts
   the session and looks like a hung server from the client end. This repository has had one.
2. **No document or comment content is logged, at any level.** The client's free persistence makes
   this stricter rather than looser — our stderr lands in a cache directory we cannot see or
   purge, so a debug log of untrusted content is a persistence step for an injection payload.
3. **Only an application configures logging.** A library that attaches handlers hijacks its
   embedder's configuration, and this is a library first.
