"""The JSON-RPC a standards-compliant MCP client actually receives, driven over real stdio.

**RR-006**, from the 2026-09-01 correctness review. Everything else in this suite exercises the
server *in process*, through the SDK's Python objects. That leaves the wire unasserted — and the
wire is what clients parse for protocol negotiation, display, logging and compatibility decisions.

The gap was not theoretical. `serverInfo.version` shipped **empty** from the day the server
existed until v0.36.1, because `MCPServer` defaults `version` to `""`; the test written for that
fix asserts it on the Python object, so it would still pass if the value never reached the wire.
An external reviewer found the original bug with a stdio probe, which is the argument for these
tests existing at all.

**Four attempts were needed to write the first probe**, and the reason belongs here because it is
the knowledge these tests encode:

* `server/discover` before `initialize` -> `Method not found`.
* `initialize` with `params.protocolVersion: "2026-07-28"` negotiates **down** to `2025-11-25` —
  that field is the *legacy* handshake, so asking for the modern version through it gets you the
  old one, and `server/discover` is then gated off as unreachable for a legacy peer.
* The modern handshake carries the version in `params._meta` under
  `io.modelcontextprotocol/protocolVersion`, and the envelope **also requires**
  `io.modelcontextprotocol/clientCapabilities` — omitting it is `-32602`, not a default.

Costly to rediscover, and invisible from the Python API.
