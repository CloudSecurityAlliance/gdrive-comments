"""Answering "can I have access?" — the owner's side, and why accepting is sharing.

Drive's `accessproposals` has `get`, `list`, `resolve` and **no `create`**: it cannot ask for
access, only answer requests other people made through the UI. That makes it a triage workflow,
which is what this server is for.

Two properties carry the security weight, and both are asserted here rather than assumed:

1. **`accept` is `share` in disguise** — it grants a permission, so it costs `file.share`. So
   does `deny`, because an operator who switched that capability off said this server does not
   decide who gets access.
2. **`request_message` is the sharpest untrusted input in this library.** Every other one was
   written by somebody who already had access to the file; this one is from somebody with none,
   reaching a model deciding whether to give them some.
