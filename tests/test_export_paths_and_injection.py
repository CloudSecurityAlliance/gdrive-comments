"""Where a CSV goes, and what must not be in it.

Two separate concerns that both live on the write path.

**Formula injection.** A comment on a shared document can begin with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@`, and
Excel reads such a cell as a FORMULA when the file is opened - `=cmd|' /C calc'!A0` being the
classic DDE payload. Anyone who can comment on a document we share can plant it, and the entire
purpose of this feature is that a human opens the result in a spreadsheet. v0.24.0 shipped
without the escape; this is the fix. The Google Sheet destination was never affected, because
the Sheets write uses `RAW`, which stores values as text rather than parsing them.

**Where the file lands.** `~/Downloads` is the default because it is the platform's designated
"a program gave me a file" location - discoverable in the Finder sidebar, persistent, and nobody
keeps precious unique files there. But a full path has to be allowed, for two concrete reasons:
a Claude Desktop *project* may only be able to write inside its own folder, where `~/Downloads`
is not reachable; and a Claude Code user wants the register in the repo they are working in.
Confining to Downloads would break exactly the cases where the file is most useful.

What makes an arbitrary path safe is not validating it but making the failure modes inert:

  * **nothing is ever overwritten** - an existing target gets `-TIMESTAMP` appended, so the worst
    case is an unexpected file rather than a destroyed one;
  * **the extension is forced to `.csv`**, so `~/.zshrc` becomes `~/.zshrc.csv` and is inert;
  * **directories are never created**, so a path cannot conjure a tree;
  * **the resolved absolute path is always reported**, because visibility is the last control -
    and if a timestamp was appended, it must SAY so, or the user goes looking for a name that
    does not exist.
