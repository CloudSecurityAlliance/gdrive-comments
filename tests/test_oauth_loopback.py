"""PKCE is asked for, and a stray request cannot consume the OAuth redirect.

**T28 — PKCE was inherited, not requested.** `build_flow` never passed `code_verifier` or
`autogenerate_code_verifier`, so PKCE S256 was active only because
`google-auth-oauthlib`'s default happens to be on.

Worth being precise, because the audit's stated rationale for this did not hold and the fix is
narrower than it proposed. It suggested the `>=1.0` floor *"admits releases where the default is
off"*; downloading the sdists showed **1.0.0 already defaults it on**, as do 1.2.0 and 1.4.1. So
raising the floor was not done and would have bought nothing.

What is real is the *inheritance*: a security property we depend on, that nothing in this
codebase asks for and no test observes. A future release flipping that default would be silent.
Asking explicitly costs one keyword and turns an assumption into a statement — and unlike a
version bound, it constrains what the code **does** rather than what may be **installed**.

**T30 — the one-shot collector consumed any request.** The WSGI app recorded
`request_uri(environ)` and set `arrived` for **any path and any method**, with no test for
`code` or `state`, and the server served exactly one request. So any local process scanning
`127.0.0.1`, or any page issuing a cross-origin GET during the 300-second window, consumed the
listener and the real redirect was refused. **A stray browser `/favicon.ico` fetch does it by
accident.**

Availability only — `state` and PKCE still prevent a forged code being exchanged, so this is not
a path to a token. It is a path to a login that fails for reasons nobody can diagnose.
