"""The job that can mint a publishing credential runs nothing of ours.

`release.yml` used to do everything in one job that held `id-token: write`: `pip install`
resolving lower-bound-only ranges, `pip-audit`, `bandit`, the full test suite, and
`python -m build`. Every one of those executes third-party code, and any of it could have read
`ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_URL` / `_TOKEN` from the job environment, minted a PyPI-audience OIDC
token, and published arbitrary artifacts as `csa-google-workspace`.

That is **amplification** rather than a vulnerability of ours — it needs a compromised dependency
first, which is outside our control. What it does is turn *"a dependency was compromised"* into
*"our published artifact was compromised"*, and that lands on every operator holding a full-Drive
token.

Split in 0.30.4: `build` runs all of it and holds no credential; `publish` holds the credential
and runs one action against downloaded artifacts.

**Why this is a test and not just a fix.** The property is one careless step from gone. Adding
`actions/checkout` to `publish` "to read the version", or a `pip install` "to check something
first", restores the exact exposure — and it would look entirely reasonable in review. So the
shape is asserted rather than remembered.

The assertions are deliberately about **structure**, not about a list of forbidden strings: the
credential-holding job may not check out the repository, may not run shell, and may use only
actions on a named allowlist. A new step has to be added to that list on purpose.
