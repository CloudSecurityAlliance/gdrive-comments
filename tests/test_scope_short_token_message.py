"""A token that exists and is one scope short is not "no token".

**Found live, 2026-08-31**, on the first install to upgrade across v0.34.0. The message said:

    Not authorized to reach Google yet (cached credentials lack the required scopes).
    No usable token at ~/.csa_google_workspace/token.json.

Both clauses at once, and the second was **false** — the token was sitting there, valid, with
its original four scopes. It was one short, because v0.34.0 added `drive.labels.readonly`.

**Why this state is new rather than rare.** Every earlier re-consent was a fresh install or an
expiry, and "no usable token" was true for both. v0.34.0 is the first release where an existing,
working token became insufficient — and every future scope addition does it again. So the
sentence had never been wrong before, and would have been wrong every time from now on.

Two consequences a reader acts on, which is why this is worth a test rather than a reword:

1. **"No token" sends you looking for a missing file** — or makes you think a login was lost —
   when the fix is a re-consent of a login that is fine.
2. **`login` may not be enough.** A plain `login` can find a loadable token and decline to do
   anything; the scope-short case needs `--force`. Telling somebody to run the command that
   no-ops is worse than telling them nothing.
