"""Naming of the folder the live suite creates its throwaway files in.

**Offline, and it lives HERE rather than in `tests/` for an import reason worth knowing.**
`tests/` has no `__init__.py`, so `tests.integration.…` resolves only when the repo root
happens to be on `sys.path` — true locally, false under CI's invocation, which is where the
first version of this file died with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tests'`.
`tests/integration/` *is* a package, so pytest imports these modules as `integration.<name>`
and a **relative** import from a sibling always works.

It carries no `CSA_GW_INTEGRATION` gate on purpose: the naming logic is the part that decides
*where somebody's Drive gets written to*, and it should not need credentials to be checked.
The live suite beside it stays gated.

**Drive does not enforce unique names.** Creating a folder never overwrites one — it quietly
makes a second folder with the same name. So the check is not about overwriting. It is about
never adopting a folder somebody else made, and never leaving two identically-named folders
with no way to tell which run owned which.
