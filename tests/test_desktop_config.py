"""D2: make Claude Desktop work, instead of documenting why it does not.

The failure, which is macOS-specific and unavoidable: **Claude Desktop is a GUI app**, so it
inherits launchd's `PATH` — `/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin`. That contains neither `~/.local/bin`
(where `pipx` puts the console script) nor Homebrew, and the `python3` it does contain is macOS's
system 3.9, below this package's 3.10 floor. So a bare command name is not found, and `python3` is
the wrong interpreter. Claude Code, running in your shell, works fine — which makes this look like
a Desktop bug rather than a `PATH` fact.

The README has documented the fix for months: put the **absolute path** in
`claude_desktop_config.json`. That was not a fix, it was a workaround with a hand-edit in it —
the user has to know their own home directory, produce valid JSON, and not clobber the other
servers already in that file. Half the intended clients are Desktop.

So the tool writes it. It knows its own absolute path; the user should not have to.

There is a second half people hit immediately after the first: **Desktop has no shell**, so the
policy environment variables that work in a terminal are simply absent. `configure` carries the
CSA_GW_* variables from the environment it runs in into the config's `env` block, which is the
only place Desktop will read them.
