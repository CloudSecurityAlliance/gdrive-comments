It had drifted, and in the direction that costs most: the list named fifteen tools while the
server registered twenty-five, so every content-write tool, `create_file`, `copy_file`,

this project does what they need. A README that undersells is not a cosmetic problem - it is
the only thing most readers will ever look at.

# to be the list is the list" — and that left the comparison table 200 lines further down
# completely unguarded. It drifted, badly: five tools that shipped in 0.15.0 were still marked
# `✗ planned` ten releases later, and the count still said 13 when the server registered 31.
# Somebody reading to decide whether this project does what they need was being told it does
# less than it does, by the project itself.

# tools (`—` for capabilities with no tool, prose in the first cell). So instead of "the table
# equals the registry", the rule is two-directional and narrower:
#
#   a registered tool may never be marked planned    (undersell — what actually happened)
#   an unregistered tool may never be marked shipped (oversell — the worse failure)
