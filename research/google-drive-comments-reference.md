# Google Drive & Sheets Comments — API Reference & Behavior

> **Verified against Google Workspace documentation and primary sources in July 2026.**
> This document consolidates and supersedes the earlier `Google Drive API Comment-Related Capabilities.md`, `report-claude.md`, and `report-chatgpt.md`. See `../CHANGELOG.md` for what changed and why.

---

## TL;DR

1. **Comments live in the Google Drive API v3, not the Sheets API.** All comment/reply CRUD goes through `/drive/v3/files/{fileId}/comments`. The Sheets API cannot create, read, or delete comments.
2. **There are 10 methods total** — 5 on `comments`, 5 on `replies`. (An earlier draft claimed 12; there is **no `patch` method** in v3.)
3. **You cannot reliably anchor a comment to a specific Sheets cell via the API.** Google Workspace editors treat API-created anchors as *un-anchored*. This is the central, load-bearing limitation of the whole problem space.
4. **To map a comment back to an A1 cell, you must export the sheet as XLSX and parse the comment XML.** The Drive `anchor` field *is* structured for Sheets (format `workbook-range`), but its `range` is an opaque internal ID — not A1 — so it isn't a usable read path. (Empirically confirmed 2026-07-09; see §7.)
5. **If you need text truly attached to a cell, use a Sheets *note* (Sheets API), not a comment.** Notes are genuinely cell-anchored; comments are file-level in practice.
6. `resolved` is read-only — resolve/reopen only by posting a **reply with an `action`**. Deletion is **soft**.

## 1. Which API handles what?

Google Sheets has **two distinct annotation systems**, and this is the root of most confusion:

| | **Notes** | **Comments** |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | Plain text stuck to a single cell (classic "Insert note") | Threaded discussion: replies, resolve/reopen, @mentions, author attribution |
| API | **Sheets API** — the cell's `note` field, set via `spreadsheets.batchUpdate` (`updateCells`/`repeatCell`) | **Drive API v3** — `comments` / `replies` resources |
| Genuinely cell-anchored? | **Yes** — anchoring is a property of the cell | **No** (file-level in practice; see §5) |
| Threading / resolution? | No | Yes |

**Rule of thumb:** need text reliably attached to a cell → *note*. Need a discussion thread with resolution → *comment* (and accept it will be file-level).

## 2. Comments resource (Drive API v3)

Base path: `https://www.googleapis.com/drive/v3`
Reference: <https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/comments>

### Methods (5)

| Method | HTTP verb | Endpoint |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `create` | POST | `/files/{fileId}/comments` |
| `get` | GET | `/files/{fileId}/comments/{commentId}` |
| `list` | GET | `/files/{fileId}/comments` |
| `update` | PATCH | `/files/{fileId}/comments/{commentId}` |
| `delete` | DELETE | `/files/{fileId}/comments/{commentId}` |

> There is **no `comments.patch`** in v3. `update` is the only body-mutating method and it uses the **PATCH** verb. `comments.patch` existed only in the legacy **v2** API.

### Comment resource fields

| Field | Type | Writable? |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `content` | string | **Yes** — plain text; required at create |
| `anchor` | string (JSON) | Settable at create; effectively immutable after (see §7) |
| `quotedFileContent` | object `{mimeType, value}` | Settable at create — the file content the comment refers to |
| `id`, `kind` (`drive#comment`) | string | No (output only) |
| `createdTime`, `modifiedTime` | RFC 3339 string | No |
| `author` | `User` object | No |
| `htmlContent` | string | No — server-rendered HTML for display |
| `resolved` | boolean | **No — output only** (see §4) |
| `deleted` | boolean | No |
| `replies[]` | array of `Reply` | No |

> **`resolved` is ABSENT until first resolved (MEASURED 2026-07-20).** On a freshly
> created comment the `resolved` key is **not present at all** — it only appears once a
> `resolve`/`reopen` action has ever occurred on the thread. Treat a **missing `resolved`
> as `false`**; do not assume the field is always returned. Likewise `anchor` and
> `quotedFileContent` are omitted when empty. See [`experiments/comment-lifecycle`](../experiments/comment-lifecycle/).

### `comments.list` parameters

| Parameter | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| `pageToken` | Pagination cursor |
| `pageSize` | 1–100, default 20 |
| `startModifiedTime` | RFC 3339; minimum `modifiedTime` filter. **comments-only** (not on replies.list) |
| `includeDeleted` | Default false; deleted comments come back with content stripped |
| `fields` | **REQUIRED** — see box below |

> ⚠️ **`fields` is mandatory.** Google requires the `fields` parameter for *every* method of the `comments` and `replies` resources **except `delete`**. These methods return no default field set; omitting `fields` errors. Example: `fields="comments(id,content,author,resolved,anchor,replies),nextPageToken"`.

---

## 3. Replies resource (Drive API v3)

Reference: <https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/reference/rest/v3/replies>

### Methods (5)

| Method | HTTP verb | Endpoint |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `create` | POST | `/files/{fileId}/comments/{commentId}/replies` |
| `get` | GET | `/files/{fileId}/comments/{commentId}/replies/{replyId}` |
| `list` | GET | `/files/{fileId}/comments/{commentId}/replies` |
| `update` | PATCH | `/files/{fileId}/comments/{commentId}/replies/{replyId}` |
| `delete` | DELETE | `/files/{fileId}/comments/{commentId}/replies/{replyId}` |

### Reply resource fields

| Field | Type | Writable? |
|-------|------|-----------|
| `content` | string | **Yes** — required *unless* `action` is set |
| `action` | string | **Yes** — one of exactly `resolve` or `reopen` (see §4) |
| `id`, `kind` (`drive#reply`) | string | No |
| `createdTime`, `modifiedTime` | RFC 3339 string | No |
| `author` | `User` object | No |
| `htmlContent` | string | No |
| `deleted` | boolean | No |

`replies.list` supports `pageToken`, `pageSize`, `includeDeleted`, and requires `fields`. It does **not** support `startModifiedTime`.

> **Reading full thread history (MEASURED 2026-07-09).** `comments.list` returns each comment's whole thread inline via the `replies` array — chronological, with author, timestamp, and a `resolve`/`reopen` `action` per reply (your audit trail). **You must expand reply subfields** (`replies(author(displayName),content,createdTime,action,deleted)`); requesting bare `replies` returns them empty. **@mentions are plain text** inside `content` (e.g. `@user@example.com …`) — there is no structured mention object.

---

## 4. Resolution model

`resolved` on a comment is **read-only**. You cannot set it via `comments.update`. A comment is resolved (or reopened) **only by creating a reply with an `action`**:

```jsonc
// POST /files/{fileId}/comments/{commentId}/replies?fields=id,action
{ "action": "resolve" }   // or "reopen"; content optional when action is set
```

Valid `action` values: **`resolve`**, **`reopen`** (exactly these two).
Source: [Manage comments and replies](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-comments)

> ⚠️ For **Sheets specifically**, resolution set via the API may not reliably reflect in the Sheets UI — this is part of the same anchoring/UI-sync gap described in §7.

---

## 5. Deletion model

Deletion is **soft** for both comments and replies. Drive marks the resource `deleted: true` and strips `content`/`htmlContent`; the record is retained to preserve thread structure. Only the author (or file owner, per permissions) may delete.

> **MEASURED 2026-07-20.** A deleted comment (a) **disappears from `comments.list` by default** — you must pass `includeDeleted=true` to see it — and (b) comes back stripped of **`author` as well as content** (only `id`, timestamps, `deleted:true`, and `replies` remain; each reply also flips `deleted:true`). Any code reading a deleted comment must tolerate a **missing author**. See [`experiments/comment-lifecycle`](../experiments/comment-lifecycle/). *(Also confirmed there: a reply with `{"action":"resolve"|"reopen"}` and **no content** is accepted, and `resolved` on the parent flips accordingly — so resolve/reopen need not carry text.)*

---

## 6. OAuth scopes

Comments are governed by the **standard Drive scopes** — there is no comment-specific scope:

| Scope | Use |
|-------|-----|
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly` | Read comments/replies |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file` | Read/write on files the app created or the user opened with it (least-privilege for writes) |
| `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive` | Full Drive access |

> ❌ **`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.comments` is not a real scope.** It appeared in an earlier draft (`report-claude.md`) and is incorrect. Use the scopes above.

Permission model: reading requires ≥ *reader*; creating comments/replies requires ≥ *commenter*; edit/delete is restricted to the author (or owner).

---

## 7. The `anchor` field — the hard truth for Sheets

This is the single most error-prone topic and the reason cell-precise comment tooling for Sheets is so hard.

### Official description
`anchor` is a **JSON string** that "defines a region in a file to which a comment refers." The only concrete worked example Google publishes is Docs-oriented:

```python
anchor = {"region": {"kind": "drive#commentRegion", "line": <n>, "rev": "head"}}
```

Google explicitly says developers "can define their own format for the anchor specification" — **and that when they do, "Google Workspace editor apps treat these comments as un-anchored comments."** Anchors are also immutable and "position relative to content cannot be guaranteed between revisions."
Source: [Manage comments and replies](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-comments)

### What a real Sheets anchor looks like (MEASURED 2026-07-09)
We ran a probe ([`experiments/anchor-probe`](../experiments/anchor-probe/)) against a live sheet. A comment placed on cell **B11** *in the Sheets UI* returned this `anchor` from `comments.list`:

```json
{"type":"workbook-range","uid":0,"range":"1453957822"}
```

So the earlier "anchors are opaque / undocumented" framing was **too strong, and partly wrong**:
- The anchor **is** structured, and the format is **`workbook-range`** — which an earlier draft had (incorrectly) listed as unverified folklore. It is real.
- **But it is still not A1-decodable.** `uid` is a sheet index and `range` (`"1453957822"`) is an **opaque internal range identifier**, not row/column and not `B11`. You cannot derive the cell from the anchor alone.

### Writing a cell anchor doesn't work (CONFIRMED, MEASURED)
In the same probe, a comment created via the Drive API with an anchor targeting B11 (`{"r":"head","a":[{"sht":{"sid":0,"rng":{"r":10,"c":1}}}]}`) was **stored verbatim** in the `anchor` field but **landed on A1**, not B11, in the exported sheet — i.e. the editor ignored the coordinates. Custom anchors are effectively unanchored. Corroborated by [Pipedream #18185](https://github.com/PipedreamHQ/pipedream/issues/18185) (marked *blocked*) and [a-bonus/google-docs-mcp](https://github.com/a-bonus/google-docs-mcp).

### Reading a comment's cell — use XLSX export (CONFIRMED, MEASURED)
Because the anchor's `range` is opaque, the reliable way to answer "which cell is this comment on?" is to export and parse:

1. **Export** as XLSX: `GET /drive/v3/files/{spreadsheetId}/export?mimeType=application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet`
2. **Unzip** and parse the comment parts. Sheets comments export as **threaded comments** — `xl/threadedComments/threadedComment*.xml` — and are mirrored into legacy `xl/comments*.xml` for compatibility. Both carry the cell as a **`ref` in A1 notation**:
   ```xml
   <threadedComment ref="B11" dT="2026-07-10T04:13:16.00" personId="…" done="0">
     <text>THIS IS A TEST COMMENT …</text>
   </threadedComment>
   ```
   (Our probe recovered `ref="B11"` for the UI comment — the mapping the Drive anchor won't give you.)
3. Map to a clean result, e.g. `{"range": {"a1Notation": "B11", "row": 11, "col": 2}, "comment": [...]}`.

This matches tanaikech's [DocsServiceApp](https://github.com/tanaikech/DocsServiceApp) ("there are no methods for retrieving the comments with the cell coordinate in the existing … Sheets API"). See also [How to map Google Sheet Comments to an A1 range](https://support.google.com/docs/thread/234205749).

### What a real DOCS anchor looks like (MEASURED 2026-09-02)

The section above is about Sheets. Docs was unmeasured until
[`experiments/docs-anchor-states`](../experiments/docs-anchor-states/RESULTS.md) placed six
comments through the editor by keyboard automation. A comment on a text selection returned:

```
anchor : kix.ce7ypxwipivp        <- an opaque string, NOT JSON
```

**Google's only published Docs example is wrong about the real format.** The guide shows

```python
anchor = {"region": {"kind": "drive#commentRegion", "line": <n>, "rev": "head"}}
```

— which carries a **position**. The editor produces an opaque `kix.*` id instead. So Docs is in
exactly the same position as Sheets: the anchor is a **key, not a coordinate**, and a comment
cannot be located from it.

`kix.XXXX` is listed below as a still-unobserved *Sheets* format, and that remains true — it is
the **Docs** namespace, and for Docs it is the whole story.

### Three behaviours that make the opaque Docs anchor survivable (MEASURED 2026-09-02)

These matter more than the anchor format, because together they mean the missing coordinate costs
nothing:

1. **A caret with nothing selected snaps to the enclosing word.** A comment placed with no
   selection came back quoting `"paragraph"` — the word the cursor sat in. So *"anchored but
   nothing selected"* does not exist for text in Docs.
2. **Docs refuses to comment on an empty paragraph.** `Cmd+Alt+M` opens no comment box at all;
   the editor requires something to anchor to.
3. **`quotedFileContent.mimeType` is `text/html`, but the value is PLAIN TEXT.** Verified on a run
   confirmed bold through the Docs API: the value carried no markup. So a stored quote can be
   matched directly against extracted plain text — which is what staleness detection depends on.

Consequently the only anchored comments **without** quoted text are those on **non-text objects**:
a comment on an inline image returned `anchor: kix.y1h574n5va9q` with `quotedFileContent` **absent**.

### The FOUR anchor states, and how to tell them apart (MEASURED 2026-09-02 and 2026-09-03)

`anchor` presence and `quotedFileContent` presence are **independent**, so there are four
combinations. `quoted_text` alone distinguishes none of them.

| state | `anchor` | `quotedFileContent` | produced by |
|---|---|---|---|
| file-level (no anchor at all) | key **absent** | key **absent** | editor or API |
| anchored to a non-text object (image) | present | key **absent** | editor |
| anchored to text (including a bare caret) | present | present | editor |
| **quoted, no anchor** | key **absent** | **present** | **API only** |

Drive **omits** absent fields rather than returning them as `null`, so "key absent" is the only
form absence takes — a `""`-versus-`None` distinction would be one a consumer invented, not one
Drive draws.

*(This section said **three** states until 2026-09-03. The first three were measured from the
editor in [`experiments/docs-anchor-states`](../experiments/docs-anchor-states/RESULTS.md), and
the fourth is unreachable that way — the editor snaps a bare caret to the enclosing word and
refuses to comment on empty space, so it cannot produce a quote without an anchor. It took a
consumer hitting it on real material (#372) to go and look.)*

**The fourth state is not a corruption, and a well-informed tool creates it deliberately.**
Measured in [`experiments/api-created-comment-states`](../experiments/api-created-comment-states/RESULTS.md):
`comments.create` accepts `quotedFileContent` with no `anchor` and returns it verbatim. And since
an API-supplied anchor is stored but treated as *un-anchored* by the editors (§7), a client that
knows this omits the useless field and keeps the quote. **So expect this shape on any file
another tool has written to** — and do not read it as file-level: these carry real, often long
quotations.

**`quotedFileContent.mimeType` carries no information** (measured 2026-09-03). Send
`text/plain` on create and Drive returns **`text/html`** — it normalises the field regardless of
what the client sends, while the value stays plain text. Every comment reports `text/html`
whatever it was created with, so **do not branch on it**. The value itself is byte-verbatim,
including leading whitespace, embedded newlines and tabs.

### ⚠️ Still-unobserved formats
These circulated in earlier drafts and were **not** seen in the probe. Do not rely on them:
- `R1C2` as a comment anchor — *R1C1 is real, but as Sheets API **range** notation (`Sheet1!R1C1:R2C2`), not a comment anchor.*
- `sheet_id=123456&range=A1` query-style anchors — no source.
- `{"a":[{"type":"cell_classifier",…}]}` / `range_classifier` / the `{a:[{sht:{sid,rng:{r,c}}}]}` shape a-bonus's code parses — **not** what a real UI comment returns (which is `workbook-range` with an opaque id). See [`server-landscape.md`](./server-landscape.md#open-discrepancy).
- `anchor=kix.XXXX` — `kix` is the **Google Docs** editor's internal namespace, not Sheets.

Bottom line: the Sheets anchor is **structured but not A1-decodable** (`workbook-range` + opaque range id). Treat it as unusable *for writes* and *for deriving A1 on reads* — use XLSX export to recover the cell.

## 8. Practical workarounds

Three real, ecosystem-used patterns:

1. **Embed a clickable cell hyperlink in the comment body.** The comment stays file-level, but readers can click through to the target cell (a-bonus's `createSheetsComment` with `includeCellLink=true`).
2. **Use a native Sheets *note* when text must live on the cell** — written via the Sheets API `note` field. Notes are truly cell-attached.
3. **Read side: export-as-XLSX and parse comment XML** to recover A1 positions (§7).

---

## 9. File-type support notes
- **Anchored comments** are supported for Google Workspace editor files *in principle* (Docs honors text-range anchors better than Sheets does).
- **Docs comments anchor well and are self-describing (MEASURED 2026-07-20).** A UI comment on a Doc returns a `kix.*` anchor **and a populated `quotedFileContent`** (the exact text the comment sits on) — e.g. `anchor:"kix.nhqmp3maw4gt"`, `quotedFileContent.value:"This is a suggested"`. So Docs comment→location mapping is trivial from the API alone, unlike Sheets (which needs the XLSX-export detour in §7). Measured via [`experiments/docs-suggestions`](../experiments/docs-suggestions/).
- **Blob (non-Google) files** support **unanchored comments only**.
- Sheets is the problematic case: anchors are accepted by the API but not honored by the editor.
