"""Assert the controls that are configured OUTSIDE this repository (T19/T27, #189).

Three things this project relies on live in GitHub's and PyPI's settings, not in the tree:

1. the **PyPI Trusted Publisher binding constrained to the `pypi` environment** — without the
   constraint, the approval gate is enforced only by a line of YAML inside the repo being
   published, so anyone able to edit the workflow could delete it and still publish
   (`RELEASING.md`, *Why the environment name is not optional*);
2. the **`pypi` GitHub Environment still having required reviewers** — it lost them once
   already, noted in v0.21.0;
3. **branch protection on `main` requiring status checks** — the stated premise of
   `dependabot-auto-merge.yml`, the only workflow holding `contents: write` on a PR trigger.

Each was recorded as prose. `RELEASING.md` reasons about the first correctly and at length,
and prose is exactly what does not notice when a setting is toggled and forgotten.

## Three states, and the third is why this script exists

A control check that cannot reach its evidence and reports success is worse than no check: it
reads as a control from the outside while asserting nothing. So every control resolves to
**OK**, **VIOLATED**, or **UNVERIFIABLE**, and the three are never collapsed:

* any **VIOLATED** exits non-zero — the setting is wrong, now;
* **UNVERIFIABLE** is printed as loudly as a failure but does not fail on its own, because the
  commonest cause is a token without admin rights, which is a fact about the caller;
* **everything unverifiable** exits non-zero. Nothing was checked, and a run that checks
  nothing must not look like a clean bill of health.

`--strict` promotes UNVERIFIABLE to a failure, for a caller that knows it holds the rights.

## What this can and cannot tell you

It detects **drift**: a setting changed by hand, a reviewer list emptied, a protection rule
dropped during unrelated repo surgery. That is the realistic failure and it is silent today.

It does **not** defend against someone who can edit this repository, because they can edit
this script. That limit is the same self-referential problem `RELEASING.md` analyses for the
publisher binding, and the same answer applies: the control that survives an attacker with
repo access is the one enforced by PyPI and GitHub, not the one asserting it.

## Credentials

Two of the three need none. `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/environments` answers unauthenticated
for a public repo, and PyPI serves the publisher's environment claim in the public PEP 740
provenance. **Branch protection needs admin rights**: it 401s unauthenticated, and a workflow's
`GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot read it either — there is no `administration` permission to grant it. So
in CI that one reports UNVERIFIABLE unless an optional read-only token is supplied.

    python scripts/check_controls.py [--strict] [--repo owner/name]

`GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GH_TOKEN` is used if set.
