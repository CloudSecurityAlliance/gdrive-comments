# These pin what *our automation* installs. They do NOT pin what users get: the ranges in
# `pyproject.toml` stay permissive on purpose, because pinning a library's dependencies pushes
# a resolution problem onto every application that depends on it. Reproducible CI and a
# permissive published package are different questions (audit 2026-08-27-01, T18/GA-#28).

# --python-version 3.10 IS LOAD-BEARING. Without it `uv pip compile --universal` resolves
# against the interpreter you happen to be running - it does not take the floor from
# `requires-python` in pyproject.toml - and quietly emits a lock that cannot install on our
# oldest supported Python. Measured: it pinned `rpds-py==2026.6.3` (requires >=3.11), which
# installs on four of the five matrix legs and fails the fifth.
